# SQLite PyInterface
Interface for various parts of SQL in python.
Moves aspects such as Tables to python to prevent messing around with commands in python.

DataBase handles the loading of a database as well as holds methods to help manipulate it.
Table handles a table in SQL with both it's name as well as a dictionary of it's values.
Currently Int and Varchars have been translated into python.

This is an incomplete project and will be updated with features when needed.
